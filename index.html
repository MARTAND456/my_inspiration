Sachin received Arjuna Award in the year 1994 for his achievements in cricket, he also received the Rajiv Gandhi Khel Ratna award in 1997 which is one of Indiaâ€™s highest Honours in the sports field. In the year 2008 Sachin received Padma vibhushan award for his achievements in the field of cricket.

In the year 2012 December, Sachin announced his retirement from one-day international cricket and subsequently in the year 2013 he announced retirement from all forms of cricket.
